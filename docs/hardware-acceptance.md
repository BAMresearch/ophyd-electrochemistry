# Hardware acceptance record template

All gates are **NOT RUN**. Execute first with a characterized dummy load/source,
never infer a gate pass from docs or a simulator. Keep raw scope traces and
instrument buffers with each record. Firmware changes invalidate relevant gates.

| Gate | Test | Required evidence |
|---|---|---|
| G01 | Immediate/external START, READY race, held/stale/repeated START | Output off before START; post-READY edge never lost; stale edge never starts next run; READY/BUSY timing traces |
| G02 | Programmatic and external abort in wait, measure, delay, rest, sourcing, export | Verified OFF mode, retained data, coincident START priority, no re-enable; worst observed and bounded latency against a declared requirement |
| G03 | V/I field origins, timestamp alignment, configured storage capacity | Known load/source comparisons, measure/readback configuration, raw buffer mapping, paired-record budget, no wrap |
| G04 | Requested periods, CV segments, pulses and integration settings | Actual timing distributions/jitter under ranges, NPLC/autozero/filter settings; reject impossible periods |
| G05 | VISA resource, error/termination, partial transfer, abort during retrieval | Identity/firmware, TSP mode, bounded transaction behavior, abort starvation bound, no competing controllers |
| G06 | Clock anchor/drift and detector exposure correlation | Bracketed anchors, offset/resolution/uncertainty, hardware marker/exposure comparison across a long run |
| G07 | Missing START, disconnect, worker kill, prepare fault, pause, recovery | Instrument-local finite timeout/output shutdown; UNKNOWN reporting on lost confirmation; no auto-rearm/data loss |

## Per-gate form

- Gate and contract clauses:
- Date / operator / reviewer:
- Instrument model, serial, firmware, reference manual:
- Python, dependencies, Git commit, runtime ABI/digest:
- Wiring/pinout, load/source, ranges, protection/off-mode configuration:
- Declared limits (including latency and timing tolerance):
- Reproduction procedure and repetitions:
- Observations, failures, raw evidence paths/checksums:
- Result: NOT RUN / FAIL / PASS (with scope of applicability):
- Capability enabled / residual limitation:

An opt-in hardware fixture must require explicit resource/configuration and
confirm the dummy-load setup. Future `pytest -m hardware` must fail if requested
hardware or required evidence is absent; it must not silently report acceptance
through skips. No hardware test code is present in this baseline.
